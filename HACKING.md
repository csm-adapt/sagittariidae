# Sagittariidae development

## Setup

It is good Python development practice to set up a virtual environment.  This
will allow you to manage Sagittariidae's dependencies independently of other
Python projcts and so avoid versioning conflicts.  We recommend
[Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html#), but
[virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) is also a
popular option.

Having set up and activated a virtual environment for Sagittariidae, install
the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
